XLarge
======

The project XLarge is a simple clone of the social media platform **Medium**. The Medium is founded by the Twitter co-founder *Evan Williams*. Medium is actually an online publishing platform that allows people to express their ideas and emotions in a more structured way, which allows users to use Medium as an online newspaper. With the growing user base of Medium, it has become one of the biggest points for people and companies from different environments to meet. 

**Why did we choose to build a Medium clone?**

As the daily users of the Medium platform, we wanted to understand the basics of the platform, and if we succeed with building the clone, make it open source for everyone to use or get inspired. Building a platform which the developer is already committed is a different experience, allowing the developers to get insights about the tricks of building the platform, and also gives a better understanding of the structure of the platform.
